# Writer-Identification-From-Handwritten-Bangla-Text-Images-Using-Deep-Learning-Methods-Codes-

---------------ABSTRACT---------------

Writer identification from handwritten text images is considered to be one of the most challenging tasks, because of the complexity of the handwritten script. Manually extraction of unique statistical features from a handwritten text image is a complex and time consuming task and if the complexity of the patterns of handwritten text image increases then the process of extracting statistical features is going to be a more complex process. In this project we are going to apply a document level fully automated writer identification system from handwritten bangla text images using deep learning methods. We have modified and used the well known VGG(Visual Geometry Group) model, which is a convolutional neural network based deep learning model, widely used for object recognition and classification tasks and to train our model we have used transfer learning. We have conducted 4 different and unique experiments on our model from which we have got encouraging results.
